# Machine Learning with Linear Regression 
This project is the first in a series of Machine Learning micro projects. These small projects demonstrate how we can use scikit-learn to create ML models in Python,
dealing with a variety of datasets. 
For this project, we have a (fake) dataset from a (fake) Ecommerce company that sells clothing online but also has in-store style and clothing advice sessions. 
After their sessions, customers can go home and use a mobile app, or the store's website to make purchases. 
The company wants to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website, depending on which one of them has the greater impact.
